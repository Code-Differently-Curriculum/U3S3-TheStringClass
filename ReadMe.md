    char+middleName+a blank char+lastName

## Part B
### Exercise 01

#### Step 01

In the package `labs.partB.ex01` look at the file `IndexingExample` and write comments for each line of code. When complete review with instructor.

#### Step 02

In the package `labs.partB.ex01` complete the `Indexing` per the following:

        Utilizing index on the pre-defined String, start at the first e and locate the index of the very next e.

Your program is working correctly, if when run, the following is the output (Abe first name Lincoln last name):

## Part C

In this part of the lab you will complete `KeypadConversion`, the objective of your program should be to ask a user for a message and display that message as a series of key presses on a telephone keypad, seen here (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone_keypad)

Ex1: Input = b then output = 22

Ex2: Input = y then output = 999

Ex3: Input = abc then output = 222222
